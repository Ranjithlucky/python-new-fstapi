pass Statement
Definition: The pass statement is a null operation; it does nothing when executed. It's used as a placeholder where code is syntactically required but you don't want to execute any code.
Usage: Commonly used in situations where a statement is syntactically required but you haven't written the logic yet or when defining an empty function or loop.
