Random Number Generation

What: Creating arrays of random numbers or performing stochastic operations.
Why Important: Useful for creating synthetic data, initializing weights in models, or random sampling.
Usage: Generating random datasets, shuffling data, or splitting data into training and testing sets.
Statistical Functions

What: Applying statistical functions like mean, median, standard deviation, etc., to arrays.
Why Important: Basic statistics are essential for understanding data distributions and normalization.
Usage: Calculating summary statistics for features or normalizing data.
Reshaping and Resizing Arrays

What: Changing the shape or size of arrays to fit the requirements of different operations.
Why Important: Proper array dimensions are often required for matrix operations in AI.
Usage: Reshaping arrays to match input requirements for neural networks or other models.
Integration of Pandas and NumPy
What: Using Pandas and NumPy together allows for efficient data manipulation and complex numerical computations.
Why Important: Combining the power of both libraries enables advanced data analysis and preprocessing, which are crucial for preparing data for AI models.
Usage: Using NumPy arrays as the underlying data structure for Pandas DataFrames, applying NumPy functions directly to Pandas columns, or converting between the two formats.
These concepts form the foundation of working with data in Python, especially in the context of preparing and managing datasets for Generative AI projects. Understanding and mastering these concepts will enable you to efficiently handle data, perform preprocessing, and set up your datasets for successful AI model development.

import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

# 1. Array Creation and Manipulation with NumPy
# Create a random NumPy array
array_data = np.random.rand(100, 3)

# Explanation: 
# The above array has 100 rows and 3 columns filled with random float numbers between 0 and 1.

# 2. Converting NumPy Array to Pandas DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame(array_data, columns=['Feature1', 'Feature2', 'Feature3'])

# Explanation:
# We convert the NumPy array to a Pandas DataFrame, labeling the columns as Feature1, Feature2, and Feature3.

# 3. DataFrame Indexing and Slicing
# Select the first 10 rows and 'Feature1' column
subset_df = df.loc[:9, 'Feature1']

# Explanation:
# We slice the DataFrame to get the first 10 rows of 'Feature1'. This demonstrates how to access specific data.

# 4. Data Transformation - Adding a new column
df['Feature_Sum'] = df['Feature1'] + df['Feature2'] + df['Feature3']

# Explanation:
# We create a new column 'Feature_Sum' which is the sum of 'Feature1', 'Feature2', and 'Feature3'.
# This is an example of applying arithmetic operations to transform data.

# 5. Aggregation and GroupBy
# Group by a binned version of 'Feature1' and calculate mean of 'Feature_Sum'
df['Feature1_Binned'] = pd.cut(df['Feature1'], bins=5)
grouped_df = df.groupby('Feature1_Binned')['Feature_Sum'].mean()

# Explanation:
# Here, 'Feature1' is binned into 5 intervals, and then we calculate the mean of 'Feature_Sum' for each bin.
# This showcases the usage of `groupby` and aggregation.

# 6. Statistical Operations with NumPy
mean_feature1 = np.mean(df['Feature1'])
std_feature1 = np.std(df['Feature1'])

# Explanation:
# We calculate basic statistics like mean and standard deviation using NumPy, which are crucial for understanding data distributions.

# 7. Data Reshaping
reshaped_array = array_data.reshape(50, 6)

# Explanation:
# The original array is reshaped from 100x3 to 50x6. Reshaping is useful when you need to change the dimensionality of the data for various operations.

# 8. Handling Missing Data
# Introduce some NaN values in the DataFrame
df.iloc[5:10, 1] = np.nan

# Fill NaN values with the mean of the column
df['Feature2'].fillna(df['Feature2'].mean(), inplace=True)

# Explanation:
# We introduced NaN values in 'Feature2' and then filled these missing values with the column's mean.
# Handling missing data is crucial to maintaining data integrity before analysis or modeling.

# 9. Merging DataFrames
# Create another DataFrame and merge it with the existing one
df_extra = pd.DataFrame({
    'Feature1': df['Feature1'].values,
    'Extra_Feature': np.random.rand(100)
})

merged_df = pd.merge(df, df_extra, on='Feature1', how='inner')

# Explanation:
# We created a new DataFrame `df_extra` and merged it with the original DataFrame `df` on 'Feature1'.
# Merging is essential when combining datasets from different sources or tables.
