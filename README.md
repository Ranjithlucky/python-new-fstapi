break, continue, and pass are control flow statements in Python used to manage the execution of loops and conditional statements. Each serves a specific purpose:

1. break Statement:
Purpose: The break statement is used to exit a loop prematurely when a certain condition is met. Once break is executed, the loop terminates immediately, and control moves to the next statement after the loop.
Usage in Projects:
Example: In a search algorithm, you might use break when you've found the item you were searching for, and there's no need to continue looping through the remaining elements.
Explanation in Interviews: "I used break in a project to optimize a search function. When a matching record was found, the loop would terminate early to save processing time, as continuing the search was unnecessary.
