Usage in Projects:
Example: In data processing, continue can be used to skip over invalid or missing data while still processing the rest of the dataset.
Explanation in Interviews: "In one project, I used continue to skip over invalid data entries while processing a large dataset. This allowed the loop to keep running without interruption, ensuring that valid data was still processed."ChatGPT

break, continue, and pass are control flow statements in Python used to manage the execution of loops and conditional statements. Each serves a specific purpose:

1. break Statement:
Purpose: The break statement is used to exit a loop prematurely when a certain condition is met. Once break is executed, the loop terminates immediately, and control moves to the next statement after the loop.
Usage in Projects:
Example: In a search algorithm, you might use break when you've found the item you were searching for, and there's no need to continue looping through the remaining elements.
Explanation in Interviews: "I used break in a project to optimize a search function. When a matching record was found, the loop would terminate early to save processing time, as continuing the search was unnecessary.
